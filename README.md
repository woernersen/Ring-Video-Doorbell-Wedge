An angle device, also known as a wedge or corner kit, is an accessory for a Ring video doorbell that allows you to adjust the angle of the doorbell to capture a wider field of view. This is especially useful for doorbells that are mounted on angled surfaces, such as doorways or walls.

Angle devices are typically made of plastic or metal and attach to the existing doorbell mount. They come in a variety of angles, such as 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees.

Here are some of the benefits of using an angle device for your Ring video doorbell:

Improved coverage: An angle device can help you capture a wider field of view, so you can see more of what is happening around your door.
Reduced blind spots: Angle devices can help you eliminate blind spots, so you can see all approaching visitors.
